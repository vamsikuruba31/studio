# CampusConnect: Smart Event Platform

## Abstract

CampusConnect is a modern, full-stack web application designed to serve as a centralized hub for university campus events. Built with Next.js and leveraging Firebase for backend services, the platform provides a seamless experience for both event organizers and attendees. Administrative users can create, and manage event listings, complete with details such as title, description, date, department, and a promotional poster.

A key feature of CampusConnect is its integration of generative AI. When creating an event, organizers can use an AI-powered assistant to automatically generate a catchy and engaging social media caption based on the event's details. This enhances marketing efforts and streamlines the event creation process. The application's frontend is built with React and ShadCN UI components, offering a clean, responsive, and accessible user interface.
