# CampusConnect: Smart Event Platform

## Abstract

CampusConnect is a comprehensive, full-stack Next.js application designed to
revolutionize how university communities engage with campus events. It serves
as a centralized, intelligent platform that bridges the gap between event
organizers and the student body, fostering a more vibrant and connected campus
life.

Our primary goal is to simplify event management for university staff while
creating an engaging and accessible discovery experience for students. By
leveraging modern web technologies and artificial intelligence, CampusConnect
aims to be the go-to digital destination for all campus happenings, from
academic workshops to social gatherings.

The platform empowers university administrators with a secure and intuitive
dashboard. Authorized users can effortlessly create new event listings,
providing essential details like title, description, and sponsoring department.

A key innovation is the integrated AI assistant, powered by Google's Gemini
models through Genkit. This tool automatically generates compelling social
media captions, significantly reducing the marketing overhead for event
promotion. Image uploads for event posters are handled seamlessly through
Firebase Storage, ensuring that each event is visually appealing.

The application's frontend is built with React and ShadCN UI, offering a
clean, responsive, and accessible user interface for both organizers and
attendees.
